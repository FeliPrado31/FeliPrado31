# Juan Felipe @FeliPrado2

"Always do what you love", since I heard that I try to do what I like. That's why I spend most of my time learning new things.

I'm a lifelong learner. I can't imagine my life without creating, programming and devising things. I feel like I could express myself 100% when I'm programming.
